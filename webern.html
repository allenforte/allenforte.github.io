His mature works comprise two styles: the so-called free atonal music composed between 1907 and 1924, and the twelve-tone serial music that began in 1924 and extended through the remainder of his creative life. In this book an eminent music theorist presents the first systematic and in-depth study of the early atonal works, from the <i>George Lieder,</i> opus 3, through the Latin Canons, opus 16.</font>										<p><font face="Verdana,Helvetica,Geneva,Arial,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">&#147;Drawing on music-analytical procedures that he and other scholars have developed in recent years, Allen Forte argues that a single compositional system underlies all of Webern&#146;s atonal music. Forte examines such elements as pitch, register, timbre, rhythm, form, and text setting, showing how Webern displaced the functional connections of traditional tonality to create a totally new sonic universe. Although the main thrust of the study is music-analytical in nature, Forte also considers historical context and significant biographical aspects of the individual works, as well as word-music relations in the music with text.&#148;</font></p>									</td>								</tr>							</table>							<p></p>						</div>					</td>				</tr>			</table>		</div>	</body>	<!-- #EndTemplate --></html>
